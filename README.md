## Features

### Project Description

### Flipkart Grocery Sales Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from Flipkart's grocery section to gain business insights. The dataset includes two main tables: `product_data` and `monthly_sales_data`.

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryansingh95/flipkart-grocery-transaction-and-product-details). 

### Analysis Steps

#### Data Loading and Cleaning

- Loaded the `product_data` and `monthly_sales_data` tables.
- Performed data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, data type conversions, and removing duplicates.

#### Basic Descriptive Statistics

- Calculated summary statistics for numerical columns.
- Counted unique products, brands, manufacturers, and categories.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Identified and defined various KPIs related to sales, products, customers, and geography.
- Implemented KPI calculations such as total sales revenue, average order value, sales growth rate, sales per product, etc.

#### Sales Data Analysis

- Analyzed sales data to understand overall revenue trends, top-selling products, sales per category, etc.
- Visualized sales figures on a daily and monthly basis to identify patterns and trends over time.

#### Product Analysis

- Investigated product-related metrics including sales volume, top-selling products, return rates, etc.
- Calculated inventory turnover and average selling price (ASP) to assess product performance.

#### Customer Analysis

- Explored customer-related KPIs such as customer lifetime value (CLV), customer acquisition cost (CAC), repeat purchase rate, churn rate, etc.
- Analyzed customer behavior to identify repeat purchasers and churn patterns.

#### Geographic Analysis

- Examined sales data by region to understand regional revenue distribution and growth rates.
- Identified top-performing cities and assessed market penetration and sales density.
